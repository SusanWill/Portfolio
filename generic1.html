    <p>As a film-goer, I was interested in exploring data gathered from Marvel Movies between 2008 to 2023. The dataset is small and includes gross revenue, opening and second weekend revenue, budget, and critic vs audience scores: I have used Pivot Tables and Charts in Excel to analyse and visualise the data.<br>
	This is my first project in data analysis.</p>
    <p>The data was downloaded from Kaggle in a .csv file and the data reviewed, checking for missing values, inconsistent formatting etc. </p>
    <p>I was interested to see whether the popularity of the Marvel franchise had changed over the 15 year period, the budget as a percentage of gross takings, the revenue difference between opening and second weekend, critic vs audience scores vs gross takings, and the most (and least) popular films in a Marvel character/s series.</p>
	<p>For further information regarding my analysis, please see <a href="https://github.com/SusanWill/PortfolioProjects_MarvelMovies_Excel">PortfolioProjects_MarvelMovies_Excel</a> on GitHub.</p>
