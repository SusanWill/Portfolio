This will be my website portfolio, soon to be hosted via GitHub Pages once I have added more projects!

I have taken the Astral HTML website template from HTML5Up (https://html5up.net/astral) and, using skills acquired through the School of Code, amended the HTML. 

So far, I have:

•	removed the forward arrow from the "Home" page.
•	removed the "Twitter" icon and added "LinkedIn" and "GitHub". When clicked, these will now open in a new tab.
•	amended the "Work" title to "Projects". Built separate HTML pages which, when clicked, opens in a new tab with favicon relating to the analysis method used. A "Back" link has also been added.
•	amended the "Contact" page to an "About" page and removed the form.
