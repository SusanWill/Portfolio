A Work in progress!
I've taken the Astral HTML website template (available via https://html5up.net/astral) and, using skills acquired through the School of Code, I've amended the HTML.
I have:
- removed the forward arrow from the "Home" page.
- removed the "Twitter" icon and added "LinkedIn" and "GitHub". When clicked, these will now open in a new tab.
- amended the "Work" title to "Projects" and built separate HTML pages for each project which open when clicked to give further information. A "Back" link has also been added.
- amended the "Contact" page to an "About" page and removed the form.
